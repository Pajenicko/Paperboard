# Paperboard Hardware

This directory contains the hardware design files for the Paperboard e-paper display controller.

## Design Basis

The Paperboard hardware is based on the [epdiy-v7](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy-hardware) design, which provides an excellent foundation for e-paper display controllers. We've made specific modifications to optimize the board for our use case while maintaining compatibility with the epdiy ecosystem.
